# Vue Todo List

## Description

The oldie but goldie Todo List but this time with Vue!

Try it here: <a href="https://readpato.github.io/vue-todo-list/">Demo</a>

### Technologies Used

For this project the technologies and tools used were:

- Vue
- Tailwind CSS
- Vite
- Vitest
- NPM
- Cypress

#

## Installation

As this project runs with Vue and Cypress you will have to have NPM or Yarn similar and then run this little code snippet on the CLI.

```
npm install
```

This will allow to download the dependencies you need to run the Todo List properly.

#

## Utilization

The Todo List allows you to save your pending activities on a list!

Simply write a task on the input field and then either click the plus or hit enter on your keyboard and bam! A new task has been created.

If the checkbox on the left is clicked the user will be able to style the text of the task with a strikethrough!

If the user desires to eliminate a task it can simply click the 'X' icon to the right of the task field and delete it!

When there are no more tasks in the task list, a field displaying "No tasks for now!" will appear.

## Challenges Faced

- Using Vue.js for the first time!

#

## What I learned

- Being the first time using a major framework, I learned that documentation is really important. If it's good redacted, it will help the consumer to understand concepts way faster.

- Creation of Vue components named Single File Components (SFC) that encapsulates JavaScript(the logic), HTML(the template) and CSS(the style).

- How to create an app instance, text interpolation (using the Mustache syntax), directive bindings as v-bind, v-on and their respective users.

- How to use the Vue Developer Tools and Vue CLI.

- Installing SASS as a global module to be of use for all the components of the application.
